This synth depends on the DATA Rotary Encoder,
becomes useless if rotary encoder gets damaged.</br>
unless you have a software like MIDIQuest Editor Librarian.</br>

Problem #2.</br>
Data Encoder stops working IF cr2032 battery die, </br>
thats a Firmware Bug/"Feature".</br>

Problem #3.</br>
Data Encoder has No replacement, its a rare type No longer manufactured...</br>

JV-880 Encoder its physically compatible with modern KY-040 encoders, but electric signals are incompatible.</br>

Sollutions:</br>
#1.</br>
Replace rotary encoder with 3 micro switches:</br>
Left Push Right.</br>

#2. </br>
Replace with KY-040, but use old PCB.</br>

A) add a circuit with cmos logic 40 / 70</br>
B) add a micro controller or fpga to convert signals</br>
PIC, Arduino, Atmel, Propeller, Upduino, etc...</br>

The original rotary encoder has OR logic.</br>
The New encoders have +/-45Â° phase shift.</br>

P.D.</br>
There was someone selling programable expansion sound cards, JV-880 can only hold one.</br>

JV-880 has 2 different DAC chips, for MainOut 1&2, and Aux1&2.</br>
